# Reliable Password Generator

## Description

I created Reliable Password Generator to make very secure passwords and to show my skills that I have learned at bootcamp.

I have used JavaScript to generate a random password. 

This application allows user to generate a password from 8 to 128 characters,
allows to choose if user wants to use upper case or lower case letters, as well as to choose if user wants to add numbers or special sympols. However, if user does not want any above mentioned letters, characters or symbols then the password could be generated with only options user picked. For instance password could be generated with a mix of capital letters and/or simbols or generate a psssword with low case letters and/or numbers. To pick any option for the password simply enter Yes/yes/YES and if one of the options has to be ommitted then simply press "Cancel" at prompt windows.
